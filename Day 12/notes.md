# Day 12

- Not much for this day, but I was forced to brush up on my search and pathfinding algorithms knowledge.
I realize the fastest solution is to simple run BFS in reverse starting from the end point, but I didn't think of that
when initially solving the problem so I left the solution be. Fun day!
