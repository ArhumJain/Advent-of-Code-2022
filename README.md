# Advent of Code 2022
Super fun year!
- All solutions in C++
- Hardest problems were Day 16 and Day 19 for me (I feel like I am an expert in optimization problems now)

`pull.py` is a quick pull script to pull the input for the current day and copy my code template from `template.txt` into the day's folder. Quick `pip install -r requirements.txt` should get all required dependencies. Set your AoC session cookie in `.env`.

All code compiles with GCC C++14
