# Day 11 
I was planning on doing "notes" this year for problems that taught me 
something new or forced me to really see a particular process in a different way.
Day 11 finally compelled me to actually do so and I did learn quite a bit.

Notable Concepts:
- Chinese Remainder Theorem
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem
- Modular Arithmetic (so simple yet so amazing!)
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ3CD9M3nEQ&t=524s
- C++ Lambda functions (capture clauses (`[]`) are an interesting functionality)
