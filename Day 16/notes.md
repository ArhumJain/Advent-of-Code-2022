# Day 16
This was honestly a ridiculously challenge problem for me. It reminds me of Day 19 from last year - truly a 
*beacon* of suffering - on which I was stuck on for days.
Ultimatley, I wasn't able to get the cleanest nor most efficient solution (About 3 hours to output the result), but through my research before and after getting the solution, I learnt quite a bit about solving optimization problems like these in general

Notable Concepts:
- Flloyd-Warshall Algorithm - find shortest distances between all pairs of vertices
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm
- Simulated Annealing - taking advantage of LUCK!

- Dynamic Programming, something that I am somewhat familiar with but more practice never hurts
